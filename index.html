<h2>Introduction to Polygon Bridge</h2>
<p>Polygon Bridge is a secure, trustless protocol that enables seamless asset transfers between the Ethereum mainnet and the Polygon network. As a core infrastructure element for scaling Ethereum, the Polygon Bridge supports fast and low-cost movement of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, allowing users to interact with DeFi applications while minimizing gas fees.</p>

<h2>What is Polygon Bridge?</h2>
<p>The Polygon Bridge consists of two main components: the Plasma Bridge and the PoS (Proof-of-Stake) Bridge. Both facilitate token transfers but differ in terms of speed, security, and asset compatibility. The PoS Bridge is the default method, offering faster withdrawals and supporting a broader range of assets, while the Plasma Bridge provides enhanced security for specific token types.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ERC-20 and ERC-721 token support</li>
  <li>Dual-bridge architecture (PoS & Plasma)</li>
  <li>Fast withdrawals with the PoS Bridge</li>
  <li>High security via Ethereum mainnet checkpoints</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Polygon Bridge Is Important</h2>
